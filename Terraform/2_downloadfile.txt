resource "null_resource" "download_file" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "curl -o /tmp/sample-1.txt https://getsamplefiles.com/download/txt/sample-1.txt"
  }
}

terraform apply
terraform show
terraform destroy


======================================================



1. Use null_resource with local-exec provisioner to run a shell command
You can use a null_resource with the local-exec provisioner to execute shell commands like curl or wget to download files to your local machine or a target instance.

Example: Download a file locally


resource "null_resource" "download_file" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "curl -o downloaded_file.txt https://example.com/file.txt"
  }
}
Run terraform apply and Terraform will execute this command on the machine where Terraform runs.

2. Use Terraform providers that support file downloading or file resources
For some cloud providers, you might upload files to cloud storage or download files as part of provisioning.

You can use the http data source to fetch content from a URL (not for large files):


data "http" "example_file" {
  url = "https://example.com/file.txt"
}

resource "local_file" "example" {
  content  = data.http.example_file.body
  filename = "downloaded_file.txt"
}
This downloads the file content into a Terraform-managed local file.

3. Download files on remote machines
If you want to download a file on a remote VM or instance, you can use provisioners with remote-exec or use user data scripts (like in EC2) to download files during instance provisioning.

Example using remote-exec provisioner:

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  # instance config...

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "curl -o /tmp/file.txt https://example.com/file.txt"
    ]
  }
}
Summary
Method	Use Case	Notes
null_resource + local-exec	Download to local machine	Requires curl/wget installed locally
data "http" + local_file	Small files, local download	Limited size, directly managed by Terraform
remote-exec provisioner	Download files on remote server	Needs SSH access & curl/wget on server
User data or startup scripts	On instance launch	Often best for cloud VM setups
